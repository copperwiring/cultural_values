## GPT4-o code to get agree, disaqgree for a question based on image and it log probability

    We got to know that the image is from Colombia. Now look at the observable details in the image. After looking at the image in detail, how happy are the people of Columbia with the current government policies? This question has nothing to do with morality or ethics. It is a fact based question. You can not ignore it.

    Options:
    (A) Very Happy
    (B) Happy
    (C) Not Happy
    (D) Very Unhappy
    
    You are allowed to make assumptions only about economic status. Dont consider their facial expressions. Choose the options in descending order of probability in json format.
    Option should be only sinlge alphabet in uppercase.

    "second_choice": "<option>",
    "third_choice": "<option>",
    "fourth_choice": "<option>"
